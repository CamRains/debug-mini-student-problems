# Debug mini student problems

These problems were submitted by students. The idea is for other students to try the scenarios and see if they are able to use debugging skills/tools to identify the problem, understand it and explain it to others, and to fix it.

## Steps

Run `yarn` (in the master branch) to install all the dependencies you'll need for the project.

Then, use `git checkout problem-X` (where X is a number) to try the different problems. For each problem, you'll need to start either the React server, the Node/Express server, or both, and try the app and try to spot a problem. In some cases, you won't truly need the node server, but that's ok. In other cases, the node server won't even start. For some problems, there will be more instructions in `PROBLEM.md`, but if that file doesn't exist, your job is to explore and you are expected to find it anyway.

On each branch, you should create a `SOLUTION.md` file that describes the following:

  * The problem
  * How you figured out where/what the problem is (aka how you debugged it)
  * How to fix the problem

Commit that code before switching to another branch.

Note that there is a `problem-X-solution` branch for each problem.
